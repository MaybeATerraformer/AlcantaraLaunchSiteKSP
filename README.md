## This small mod adds the Alcântara launch site [(CEA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcântara_Space_Center) to the KSP Real Solar System
*The Alcântara Space Center (Portuguese: Centro Espacial de Alcântara, CEA), former known as Alcântara Launch Center (Portuguese: Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara) is a space center and launching facility of the Brazilian Space Agency in the city of Alcântara, located on Brazil's northern Atlantic coast, in the state of Maranhão. It is operated by the Brazilian Air Force (Comando da Aeronáutica). The CEA is the closest launching base to the equator. This gives the launch site a significant advantage in launching geosynchronous satellites, an attribute shared by the Guiana Space Centre.* `Wikipedia`

# Issue with *Terrain Detail*
### If your space center is underground, *don't worry*. It's just a bug (or something like that) with the terrain detail. To fix this, *try changing the terrain detail level in the KSP graphics settings (in the settings menu)*.
- `Dev comment: I think this is a recurring issue with RSS + KSC Switcher. So if you're having trouble with this on another launch site, try the same thing.`
